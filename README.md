Predicting House Rent

Project Description

Brazil Housing is an Public dataset.
 
In this dataset there are total 13 features and 10692 data-points.

This dataset contains information regarding brazil houses. Here we will predict rent of house.

We have house info like  city, area, rooms, parking space etc. 
On this basis we have to predict the “total” rent of house.
Here target variable is “total (R$)” column.

We have to clean the data and apply all the algorithms to our model and check which one gives maximum accuracy.
